# CrudOperationApi - CRUD Operations of Category and Product.

This project is a simple CrudOperationApi platform built using Spring Boot and REST APIs, demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with Hibernate mappings (One-to-Many and Many-to-One) for managing entities like Products and Categories.

## Features

•	Category Management:
          o	Add, retrieve, update, and delete categories.
          o	Each category can contain multiple product(One-to-Many mapping).
•	Product Management:
           o Create, view, update, and delete products.
           o Each product belongs to a single category(Many-to-One mapping).
•	RESTful APIs: 
            Provides clean and modular endpoints for seamless integration with third-party applications.
•	Postman Testing: 
            Includes Postman collection for testing all APIs.
•	Hibernate ORM: 
            Implements relational mappings to ensure smooth interaction with the database.
• Database Integration: 
            Persistent storage with a relational database like MySQL.

## Tech Stack

•	Springboot: Backend framework for building scalable applications.
•	Hibernate:  ORM tool for database interaction and relational mappings.
•	Spring Data JPA: For simplified data access.
•	Spring Web : for RESTful APIs
•	Springboot DevTools : for hot reloading (optional)
•	Postman: For testing and validating API endpoints.
•	MySql : For storing data in relational database.

## Hibernate Mapping

 One-to-Many (Category → Products)
            •	A single category can have multiple associated products.
Many-to-One (Products → Category) 
            •	Each product is linked to a single category.

```

#### Get item

```http
  GET /api/items/${id}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |

#### CRUD API for Categories and Products

This project implements a simple CRUD API for managing categories and products with pagination. The application allows you to create, read, update, and delete categories and products, with the products being associated with categories.

## Api Endpoints

Category Endpoints

    Get All Categories: GET /api/categories
    Get Category by ID: GET /api/categories/{id}
    Create Category: POST /api/categories
    Update Category: PUT /api/categories/{id}
    Delete Category: DELETE /api/categories/{id}


Product Endpoints

    Get All Products: GET /api/products
    Get Product by ID: GET /api/products/{id}
    Create Product: POST /api/products
    Update Product: PUT /api/products/{id}
    Delete Product: DELETE /api/products/{id}
